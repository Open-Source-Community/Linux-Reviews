# Linux Mint Review 

REVIEW BY : [Ahmed Ayman](https://github.com/a7medayman6)

## A General Look  

- Linux Mint gave me a pretty good experience, the graphical user interface is normal, 
almost looks exactly like Windows10, but after a little customization and 
playing around with the themes and terminal variables it looked beuatifull.

- Linux Mint was faster than I expected. compared to windows, linux is the rabbit while windows is a turtle.

- Installing a new software is as easy as writing one line of code, so it's pretty amazing.

- The pre-installed stuff are only the basic ones (libre office, firefox), so nothing special here.

## The Desktop Environment (DE)

- The default DE for Linux Mint is Cinamon which is a modern one.

- Cinamon is familiar to people with experience using windows.

- Cinamon offers a lot of customization and keyboard shortcuts.

- One thing I adore about the DE is the <b> hot corners </b> property which allows the user
	to use the screen corners to perform something with a custom delay, for example showing your workplaces, or your 
	open windows, or even executing a certain command which might come in handy for some users. 

- All the shortcuts are completely controlled by the user.

## Beginner Friendly ? or Not ?

- In my opinion I think Linux Mint is the best Linux distribution for beginners, using Mint is straight forward,
	the installation steps are fairly simple, lightweight, and for Windows users Mint is the best.

## The Installation

- Linux Mint installation is as easy as clicking a few next buttons.

## Who Should Use Linux Mint ? 

1. Windows users who doesn't want a significant change in the user interface.
2. Anyone who wants a lightweight, Fast OS with Linux perks. 
3. Someone who wants to try Linux for the first time.

## Linux Mint Parent

- Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Ubuntu which itself is based on Debian.
- In simpler words, Ubuntu is Mints parent and Debian is Mints Grand-parent.

## Linux Mint Package Manager

- Mints default package manager is <b>APT</b> which stands for <b>Advanced Packaging Tool</b>.
- It is a very popular, free, powerful and more so, useful command line package management system that is a front end for dpkg package management system.

## Minimum Requirements 

- 512MB RAM.
- 5GB Disk Space.
- The capability of 800x600 resolution for graphics card.
- DVD drive or USB port.

## Comfortable Requirements 

- 1GB RAM.
- 20GB Disk Space.
- 1027x768 Resolution.

## Final words

I am using Linux Mint for almost two years now as a dual boot, honestly after 2 months from installing Linux Mint 
I barely open up Windows, so I gotta say that am grateful for Linux Mint existence.
