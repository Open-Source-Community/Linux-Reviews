## What is Ubuntu-Studio?

Ubuntu Studio is a free and open source operating system, and an official flavor of Ubuntu. Ubuntu Studio is the most widely used multimedia-orientated operating system in the world. It comes preinstalled with a selection of the most common free multimedia applications available, and is configured for best performance for various purposes: Audio, Graphics, Video, Photography and Publishing.

## System Requirements:

* Required ( 2 GB Ram - 16 GB Storage )
* Recommended ( 8 GB Ram - 64 GB for audio/video work )

## Desktop Environment

* Up until version 20.10 Ubuntu Studio shipped with the Xfce desktop environment, but this was replaced by KDE Plasma in October 2020.
