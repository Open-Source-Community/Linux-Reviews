### Final Words

- parrot is a friendly, lightweight and secure operating system that can be for a daily use while providing 
the right tools for doing a penetration test, it has a user friendly look with lots of customization to
the graphical interface, while the installation is an old Debian interface but still worth it, 
I would prefer to use it as a virtual machine than an default system but it is perfectly capable and worth installing as a 
working operating system.
